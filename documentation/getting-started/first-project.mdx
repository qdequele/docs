## Creating a project

To use Meilisearch Cloud, you must first create a project. Projects act as containers for indexes, tasks, billing, and other information related to Meilisearch Cloud.

Click the "New project" button on the top menu. If you have a free trial account and this is your first project, the button will read "Start free trial" instead:

![New project](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/1-new-project.avif)

Name your project `meilisearch-quick-start` and select the region closest to you, then click on "Create project":

![Create project](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/2-create-project.avif)

If you are not using a free trial account, you must also choose a billing plan based on the size of your dataset and number of searches per month:

![Project billing](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/3-project-billing.avif)

Creating your project might take a few minutes. Check the project list to follow its status. Once the project is ready, click on its name to go to the project overview page:

![Project list](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/4-project-list.avif)

# **Creating an index and adding documents**

After creating your project, you must index the data you want to search. Meilisearch stores and processes data you add to it in indexes. A single project may contain multiple indexes.

First, click on the indexes tab in the project page menu:

![Project page menu](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/5-project-page-menu-indexes.avif)

This leads you to the index listing. Click on "Create an index":

![Index list empty](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/6-index-list-empty.avif)

Write `movies` in the name field and click on "Create Index":

![Create index](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/7-create-index.avif)

The final step in creating an index is to add data to it. Choose "File upload":

![File upload](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/8-file-upload.avif)

Meilisearch Cloud will ask you for your dataset. To follow along with this tutorial, use this [list of movies](https://www.meilisearch.com/movies.json). Download the file to your computer, drag and drop it into the specified area, then click on "Import documents":

[list of movies](https://www.meilisearch.com/movies.json)

![Data import](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/9-data-import.avif)

Meilisearch Cloud will index your documents. This may take a moment. Click on "See index list" and wait. Once it is done, click on "Settings" to visit the index overview:

![Index list filled](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/10-index-list-filled.avif)

# **Searching**

With all data uploaded and processed, the last step is to run a few test searches to confirm Meilisearch is running as expected.

Click on the project name on the breadcrumb menu to return to the project overview:

![Index list breadcrumb](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/11-index-list-breadcrumb.avif)

Meilisearch Cloud comes with a search preview interface. Click on "Search preview" to access it:

![Project page URL](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/12-project-page-url.avif)

Finally, try searching for a few movies, like "Solaris":

![Search preview](/documentation/getting-started/first-project/13-search-preview.avif)

If you can see the results coming in as you type, congratulations: you now know all the basic steps to using Meilisearch Cloud.

# **What's next**

This tutorial taught you how to use Meilisearch Cloud's interface to create a project, add an index to it, and use the search preview interface.

In most real-life settings, you will be creating your own search interface and retrieving results through Meilisearch's API. To learn how to add documents and search using the command-line or an SDK in your preferred language, check out the [Meilisearch quick start](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/self_hosted/getting_started_with_self_hosted_meilisearch).
