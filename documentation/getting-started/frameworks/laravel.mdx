description: "Integrate Meilisearch into your Laravel app."

In this guide, you will see how to setup [Laravel Scout](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scout) to use Meilisearch in your Laravel 10 application.

<Steps> 
  <Step title="Prerequisites">

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- PHP
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

You will also need a Laravel application. If you don't have one, you can create a new one by running the following command:

```sh
composer create-project laravel/laravel my-application
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Installing Laravel Scout">

Laravel comes with out-of-the-box full-text search capabilities via Laravel Scout.

To enable it, navigate to your Laravel application directory and install Scout via the Composer package manager:

```sh
composer require laravel/scout
```

After installing Scout, you need to publish the Scout configuration file. You can do this by running the following `artisan` command:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Scout\ScoutServiceProvider"
```

This command should create a new configuration file in your application directory: `config/scout.php`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuring the Laravel Scout driver">

Now you need to configure Laravel Scout to use the Meilisearch driver. First, install the dependencies required to use Scout with Meilisearch via Composer:

```sh
composer require meilisearch/meilisearch-php http-interop/http-factory-guzzle
```

Then, update the environment variables in your `.env` file:

```sh
SCOUT_DRIVER=meilisearch
# Use the host below if you're running Meilisearch via Laravel Sail
MEILISEARCH_HOST=http://meilisearch:7700
MEILISEARCH_KEY=masterKey
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Running in production">

For production use cases, we recommend using a managed Meilisearch via [Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud?utm_campaign=laravel&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=laravel-scout-guide). On Meilisearch Cloud, you can find your host URL in your project settings.

<Capsule intent="tip">
  Read the [Meilisearch Cloud quick
  start](/learn/getting_started/cloud_quick_start).
</Capsule>

If you prefer to self-host, read our guide for [running Meilisearch in production](/guides/deployment/running_production).

      </Step>

  <Step title="Making Eloquent models searchable">

With Scout installed and configured, add the `Laravel\Scout\Searchable` trait to your Eloquent models to make them searchable. This trait will use Laravel’s model observers to keep the data in your model in sync with Meilisearch.

Here’s an example model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Laravel\Scout\Searchable;

class Contact extends Model
{
	use Searchable;
}
```

To configure which fields to store in Meilisearch, use the `toSearchableArray` method. You can use this technique to store a model and its relationships’ data in the same document.

The example below shows how to store a model's relationships data in Meilisearch:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Models\Company;
use Laravel\Scout\Searchable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;

class Contact extends Model
{
    use Searchable;

    public function company(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Company::class);
    }

    public function toSearchableArray(): array
    {
	      // All model attributes are made searchable
        $array = $this->toArray();

		    // Then we add some additional fields
        $array['organization_id'] = $this->company->organization->id;
        $array['company_name'] = $this->company->name;
        $array['company_url'] = $this->company->url;

        return $array;
    }
}
```

</Step>

  <Step title="Configuring filterable and sortable attributes">

Configure which attributes are [filterable](/learn/filtering_and_sorting/filter_search_results) and [sortable](/learn/filtering_and_sorting/sort_search_results) via your Meilisearch index settings.

In Laravel, you can configure your index settings via the `config/scout.php` file:

```php
<?php

use App\Models\Contact;

return [
	  // Other Scout configuration...

    'meilisearch' => [
        'host' => env('MEILISEARCH_HOST', 'https://edge.meilisearch.com'),
        'key' => env('MEILISEARCH_KEY'),
        'index-settings' => [
            Contact::class => [
                'filterableAttributes' => ['organization_id'],
                'sortableAttributes' => ['name', 'company_name']
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

The example above updates Meilisearch index settings for the `Contact` model:

- it makes the `organization_id` field filterable
- it makes the `name` and `company_name` fields sortable

After changing your index settings, you will need to synchronize your Scout index settings.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Synchronizing your index settings">

To synchronize your index settings, run the following command:

```sh
php artisan scout:sync-index-settings
```

</Step>
</Steps>
