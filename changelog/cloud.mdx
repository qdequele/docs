<Update label="2024-10-28" description="v1.11.0">

## Breaking Changes
- **AI-Powered Search API:**
  - `hybrid.embedder` is now **mandatory** for both `GET` and `POST` `/indexes/{:indexUid}/search` and `/similar` endpoints.
  - The `hybrid` parameter must be included even for pure semantic searches.
  - `semanticRatio` is ignored when `vector` is used without `q`, resulting in pure semantic searches.

## New Features & Improvements
- **AI-Powered Search Enhancements:**
  - Updated default OpenAI model to `text-embedding-3-small`.
  - Introduced `documentTemplateMaxBytes` to limit the size of document templates.
  - Added `field.is_searchable` property in `documentTemplate` for better field filtering.

- **Vector Database Performance:**
  - **`binaryQuantized` Embedder Option:**
    - Converts embeddings to boolean values (`1` or `-1`), reducing database size by 10x and indexing time by 6x.
    - **Note:** Irreversible change that may affect search relevancy. Recommended to test on a smaller or duplicate index first.

- **Federated Search Enhancements:**
  - Added `facetsByIndex` to retrieve facet distributions and stats per index.
  - Introduced `mergeFacets` to combine facet data across multiple indexes.

- **Experimental Features:**
  - **`STARTS WITH` Filter Operator:**
    - Enable via the experimental features API.
    - Use in filters, e.g., `"filter": "hero STARTS WITH spider"`.
    - Feedback encouraged through the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/discussions/763).

- **Language Support:**
  - Enhanced support with ISO-639-1 and ISO-639-3 variants.
  - Added German tokenizer and improved Turkish language support.

- **UI & Logging:**
  - Updated search UI by removing forced capitalization of fields.
  - Upgraded "batch failed" logs to error level.

## Bug Fixes
- **Federated Search:**
  - Fixed issue where `query.facets` was ignored, now returns appropriate errors and requires `federation.facetsByIndex`.

- **Metrics & Logging:**
  - Corrected Prometheus `/metrics` to return real route patterns instead of route templates.

- **Facet Handling:**
  - Improved truncation logic for facet values to ensure correct values are retained based on `maxValuesPerFacet`.

- **Task Management:**
  - Enhanced task cancellation processes when using vectors.

- **Language Specific Fixes:**
  - Resolved character normalization issues for Swedish (`å`, `ä`, `ö` are no longer normalized to `a` and `o`).

- **Document Updates:**
  - Fixed internal errors related to updating documents with functions.
  - Prevented sending empty edit documents by function.

- **Search Queue & Vectors:**
  - Fixed incorrect search queue sizing in experimental search features.
  - Ensured vectors are displayed correctly when no custom vectors are provided.
